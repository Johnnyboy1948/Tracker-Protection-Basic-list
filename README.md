The Tracker Protection Basic list is a backup from a self composed list (ca. 9500 rules) I use in Adguard for Windows.
The list consists of segments of well known public filterlists.
The list on this site only contains the links to the sites of those filterlists. 
As soon as the Tracker Protection Basic List (raw-version) is placed in the (Adguard) adblocker-app and is updated, the filterrules will be included. 
The Tracker Protection Basic List is intended to be used next to an anti-tracker list on DNS-level, for instance Steven Blacks filter or the much smaller Peter Lowe's filter.
A combination with Adguards DNS-filter is also possible, but the Tracker Protection Basic filter includes a segment (with about 600 rules) of that Adguard filter. In so far there is an overlap.
For specific adblocking I recommend to use EasyList Optimized in the (Adguard) adblocker app.
All credits go to Sprout's Lucky Corner for his instruction to create an own adblocklist and of course to the suppliers of the segments.
