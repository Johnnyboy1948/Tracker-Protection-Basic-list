The Tracker Protection Basic list is a backup from a self composed list (ca. 9500 rules) I use in the desktop app Adguard for Windows.
The list only contains the links to sites with relevant sections of well known antitracker filterlists. 

As soon as the Tracker Protection Basic list (raw-version) is placed in the Adguard desktop app and is updated, the filterrules will be included. This doesn't work in ad blocking browser extensions (even not from Adguard).

The Tracker Protection Basic list is intended to be used next to an antitracker filterlist on DNS-level, for instance Steven Blacks filter or the much smaller Peter Lowe's filter.
A combination with Adguards DNS-filter is also possible, but the Tracker Protection Basic list includes a segment (with about 600 rules) of that Adguard filter. In so far there is an overlap.

For specific adblocking I prefer to use EasyList Optimized in the Adguard desktop app.

All credits go to Sprout's Lucky Corner for its instruction to create an own adblocklist and of course to the suppliers of the segments.
